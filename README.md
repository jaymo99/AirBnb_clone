## Overview
This is an open-source AirBnb clone build with Python (Flask). The project allows users to browse and book accomodation listings, manage their reservations, and leave reviews for their experiences. The application has been designed to provide a simpler but similar user experience to the official [AirBnb website](https://www.airbnb.com/), while also allowing for customization and additional features.

The project is still in its initial stages. The end goal is to have a complete web application composed by:
* A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
* A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
* A database or files that store data (data = objects)
* An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and the data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

## 1. The command interpreter
